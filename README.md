# Accent, Gender, and Age prediction based on audio
This is project for MATH UN2015 Linear Algebra & Probability in Fall semester 2024. 

This project aims to develop a predictive model that can classify speaker attributes—specifically accent, gender, and age—based on audio files. The project will use audio feature extraction techniques to capture characteristics of the speaker’s voice that are relevant to these classifications. 

Key features such as pitch, words per second, and tempo will be derived using various linear algebra-based algorithms.  The extracted features will then be used to train a logistic regression model to make predictions. Principal Component Analysis as a dimensionality reduction technique may be applied.
